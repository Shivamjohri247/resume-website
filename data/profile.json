    "intro": "Senior AI Engineer with 9.5+ years in the IT industry and 6+ years building AI/ML systems that deliver measurable business outcomes. I specialize in agentic AI, LLM-based systems, and end-to-end MLOps automation, deploying scalable, production-grade solutions. Currently at Suzega, I build autonomous agents that are context-aware, human-aligned, and designed to enhance—not replace—decision-making, leveraging structured reasoning, tool use, and memory on cloud-native infrastructure."
